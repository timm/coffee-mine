# INSTALL
# =======
# 
# 0)  Essential first step: make yourself a cup of coffee.
# 1)  Install coffee on your local machine.
# 
# 2)  Download this file and call it, say,  'lib/globals.cof'.
#     2a) Optional (UNIX systems only)
# 
#        chmod +x lib/globals.cof  # <=== On UNIX systems
# 
# 3)  Look for 'data/' in this file. Usually, its the last few
#     lines of code (above). If you see any reference to such 
#     a data file, then...
#     3a) Download those data files from
#         http://now.unbox.org/all/trunk/doc/coffee-mine/data
#     3b) Edit this file so it points to those data files.
# 
# 4)  See if this file runs:
# 
#         ./lib/globals.cof         # <=== UNIX systems
#         coffee lib/globals.cof    # <=== for other systems
# 
# To check if it is running correctly, see 
# http://coffee-mine.blogspot.com (look for blogs entries 
# around shuffle.cof).
