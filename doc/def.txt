nature is a joker. if you try to find patterns in data, you get confused. lots of things mixed up

data mning = tricks to fix the mix

and also, learning when the mix can't be fixed.

tables, not relations
rows, not instances or examples or cases
cols, not attributes, variables
scored, not classes
acts, not controllable

some cols are either scored or plain

some plain are acts (things you can change)
