Install
-------

To install any of the code in ./var/xxx

* Install coffee on your local machine.
* Download this file and call it, say,  'xxx'.
  * Optional (UNIX systems only)

    chmod +x xxx  # <=== On UNIX systems

* Look for 'data/' in this file. Usually, its the last few lines of code (above). If you see any reference to such  a data file, then...
  * Download those data files from http://now.unbox.org/all/trunk/doc/coffee-mine/data
  * Edit this file so it points to those data files.

* See if this file runs:

    ./xxx        # <=== UNIX systems
    coffee xxx   # <=== for other systems

To check if it is running correctly, see http://coffee-mine.blogspot.com (look for blogs entries around the date of the build of 'xxx').
