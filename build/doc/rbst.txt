A Comparative Analysis of Recombinant Bovine Somatotropin Adoption across Major U.S. Dairy Regions1

Bradford Barham, Jeremy D. Foltz, Sunung Moon, and Douglas Jackson-Smith


Trends and determinants in the adoption of recombinant bovine
somatotropin are examined using data from across the U.S. The core
findings are: (1) moderate adoption rates and relatively small impacts
on national milk production; (2) substantial disadoption, farmers who
have tried the technology but stopped using it; (3) no significant
differences in characteristics between adopters and disadopters; and,
(4) major differences between non-adopters and farmers who have tried
the technology, with the latter group having significantly higher use
rates of complementary, productivity- enhancing technologies and larger
herd sizes. This last result holds across states with distinctive herd
size distributions.

Sixth Circuit Holds Ohio Can’t Prohibit “rbST-Free” Labels

Last month, in International Dairy Foods Association v. Boggs,
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit struck down
Ohio’s regulations barring dairy processors from labeling milk
as “rbST-Free,” but upheld the agency’s ability to require
disclaimers for some rbST-related product claims, subject to First
Amendment constraints.   In the process the decision illustrated how
environmental preferences, such as for “organic” food, benefit from
constitutional protection of commercial speech, including product labels.

Some milk producers administer recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST, aka
recombinant bovine growth hormone or rbGH) to their dairy cows to increase
milk production.  Although there is (as yet) no scientific evidence that
the use of rbST poses any health risk to humans, or even that rbST can
be detected in milk from treated cows, some consumers prefer to purchase
milk from untreated cows.  In response to this concern, some producers
(including members of the Organic Trade Association) sought to label
their milk products as “rbST-free” or to otherwise indicate that
their milk did not come from rbST-treated cows.
